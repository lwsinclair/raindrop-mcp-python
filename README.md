# Raindrop MCP Server

This is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Raindrop.io powered by the [Python MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/tree/main). It provides an easy way to read and update your bookmarks from the Raindrop personal knowledge management system in simple, human language. This can be paired with the [Firecrawl MCP server](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl-mcp-server#) to read the URLs associated with your bookmarks and classify them accordingly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop)
- A Raindrop.io account and API token

## Setup

### 1. Obtain a Raindrop API Token

1. Go to [Raindrop.io Developer Portal](https://app.raindrop.io/settings/integrations)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy your API token

### 2. Set Your API Token

Set your Raindrop API token as an environment variable:

1. Create a .env file in the root directory
2. Add new line: ```RAINDROP_TOKEN="your_token_here"```


## Development

To run the server in development mode:

```
uv run mcp dev server.py
```

## Installation

To install the server to Claude Desktop:

```
uv run mcp install server.py
```

This will start the server locally and allow you to test changes.

## Features

The server provides:

- Access to your Raindrop collections and raindrop data through capabilities
- Support for viewing root collections, child collections, or a specific collection by ID
- Tools to create, update, and delete collections and raindrops
- Tools to create and update new tags

## Example Queries

After installing the server to Claude Desktop, you can ask Claude questions and commands like:

- "Show me all my Raindrop collections"
- "Do I have any collections related to programming?"
- "Add this tag to all raindrops in this collection"
- "Show me the details of my Raindrop collection with ID 12345"
- "What child collections do I have in Raindrop?"
- "Create a new Raindrop collection called 'Claude Resources'"

Here is some example usage in Claude Desktop (paired with a Firecrawl MCP server):

Input to Claude Desktop as the classificaiton system:
![classifier](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/648d587f-6e10-42b3-b759-878110ce1d66)

Output from Claude Desktop:
![classifier-output](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60d67757-cda5-472b-895d-c31b1fdd3631)
